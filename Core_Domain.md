# Core	Domain

In	 a	 large	 system,	 there	 are	 so	 many	 contributing	 components,	 all	 complicated	 and	 all	
absolutely	 necessary	 to	 success,	 that	 the	 essence	 of	 the	 domain	 model,	 the	 real	 business	
asset,	can	be	obscured	and	neglected.

It	 is	 harsh	 reality	 that	 not	 all	 parts	 of	 the	 design	 are	 going	 to	 be	equally	 refined.	 Priorities	
must	be	set.	To	make	 the	domain	model	an	asset,	 the	critical	core	of	 that	model	has	 to	be	
sleek	 and	 fully	 leveraged	 to	 create	 application	 functionality.	 But	 scarce,	 highly	 skilled	
developers	tend	to	gravitate	to	technical	infrastructure	or	neatly	definable	domain	problems	
that	can	be	understood	without	specialized	domain	knowledge.

## Therefore:

Boil	the	model	down.	Define	a	core	domain	and	provide	a	means	of	easily	distinguishing	it	
from	 the	 mass	 of	 supporting	 model	 and	 code.	 Bring	 the	 most	 valuable	 and	 specialized	
concepts	into	sharp	relief.	Make	the	core	small.

Apply	top	talent	to	the	core	domain,	and	recruit	accordingly.	Spend	the	effort	in	the	core	to	
find	 a	 deep	 model	 and	 develop	 a	 supple	 design—sufficient	 to	 fulfill	 the	 vision	 of	 the	
system.	

Justify	investment	in	any	other	part	by	how	it	supports	the	distilled	core.
