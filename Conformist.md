# Conformist
When	 two	 development	 teams	 have	 an	 upstream/down-stream	 relationship	 in	 which	 the	
upstream	has	no	motivation	 to	provide	 for	 the	downstream	 team’s	needs,	 the	downstream	
team	is	helpless.	Altruism	may	motivate	upstream	developers	to	make	promises,	but	they	are	
unlikely	 to	be	 fulfilled.	Belief	in	 those	good	intentions	leads	 the	downstream	 team	 to	make	
plans	based	on	features	that	will	never	be	available.	The	downstream	project will	be	delayed	
until	the	team	ultimately	learns	to	live	with	what	it	is	given.	An	interface	tailored	to	the	needs	
of	the	downstream	team	is	not	in	the	cards.

## Therefore:
Eliminate	the	complexity	of	translation	between	bounded	contexts	by	slavishly	adhering	to	
the	 model	 of	 the	 upstream	 team.	 Although	 this	 cramps	 the	 style	 of	 the	 downstream	
designers	 and	 probably	 does	 not	 yield	 the	 ideal	 model	 for	 the	 application,	 choosing	
conformity	 enormously	 simplifies	 integration.	 Also,	 you	 will	 share	 a	 ubiquitous	 language	
with	 your	 upstream	 team.	 The	 upstream	 is	 in	 the	 driver’s	 seat,	 so	 it	 is	 good	 to	 make	
communication	easy	for	them.	Altruism	may	be	sufficient	to	get	them	to	share	information	
with	you.
