# Big	Ball	of	Mud 
As	we	survey	existing	software	systems,	trying	to	understand	how	distinct	models	are	being	
applied	within	defined	boundaries,	we	find	parts	of	systems,	often	large	ones,	where	models	
are	mixed	and	boundaries	are	inconsistent.

It	is	easy	to	get	bogged	down	in	an	attempt	to	describe	the	context	boundaries	of	models	in	
systems	where	there	simply	are	no	boundaries.	

Well-defined	 context	 boundaries	 only	 emerge	 as	 a	 result	 of	 intellectual	 choices	 and	 social	
forces	(even	though	the	people	creating	the	systems	may	not	always	have	been	consciously	
aware	 of	 these	 causes	 at	 the	 time).	When	 these	 factors	 are	 absent,	 or	 disappear,	multiple	
conceptual	 systems	 and	 mix	 together,	 making	 definitions	 and	 rules	 ambiguous	 or	
contradictory.	 The	 systems	 are	 made	 to	 work	 by	 contingent	 logic	 as	 features	 are	 added.	
Dependencies	crisscross	 the	software.	Cause	and	effect	become	more	and	more	difficult	 to	
trace.	Eventually	the	software	congeals	into	a	big	ball	of	mud.

The	big	ball	of	mud	is	actually	quite	practical	for	some	situations	(as	described	in	the	original	
article	 by	 Foote	 and	 Yoder),	 but	 it	 almost	 completely	 prevents	 the	 subtlety	 and	 precision	
needed	for	useful	models.

## Therefore:
Draw	a	boundary	around	the	entire	mess	and	designate	it	a	big	ball	of	mud.	Do	not	try	to	
apply	sophisticated	modeling	within	this	context.	Be	alert	to	the	tendency	for	such	systems	
to	sprawl	into	other	contexts.
