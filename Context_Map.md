# Context	Map
*To	plot	strategy,	we	need	a	realistic,	large-scale	view	of	model	development	extending	across	
our	project	and	others	we	integrate	with.*

An	 individual	 bounded	 context	 leaves	 some	 problems	 in	 the	absence	 of	a	 global	 view.	The	
context	of	other	models	may	still	be	vague	and	in	flux.

People	on	other	teams	won’t	be	very	aware	of	the	context	boundaries	and	will	unknowingly	
make	 changes	 that	 blur	 the	 edges	 or	 complicate	 the	 interconnections.	 When	 connections	
must	be	made	between	different	contexts,	they	tend	to	bleed	into	each	other.

Even	when	boundaries	are	clear,	 relationships	with	other	contexts	place	constraints	on	 the	
nature	 of	model	 or	 pace	 of	 change	 that	 is	 feasible.	 These	 constraints	manifest	 themselves	
primarily	 through	 non-technical	 channels	 that	 are	 sometimes	 hard	 to	 relate	 to	 the	 design	
decisions	they	are	affecting.


## Therefore:

__Identify	each	model	in	play	on	the	project	and	define	its	bounded	context.	This	includes	the	
implicit	 models	 of	 non-object-oriented	 subsystems.	 Name	 each	 bounded	 context,	 and	
make	the	names	part	of	the	ubiquitous	language.__

__Describe	 the	 points	 of	 contact	 between	 the	models,	 outlining	 explicit	 translation	 for	 any	
communication,	highlighting	any	sharing,	isolation	mechanisms,	and	levels	of	influence.__

__Map	the	existing	terrain.	Take	up	transformations	later.__

This	map	can	be	a	basis	for	realistic	design	strategy.

The	characterization	of	relationships	is	made	more	concrete	in	the	following	pages,	with	a	set	
of	common	patterns	of	relationships	between	bounded	contexts.
